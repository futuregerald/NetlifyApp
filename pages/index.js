                difficult to pick only one thing, since I love the challenges, working with different technologies, and working with both technical and non-technical 
                people. I love being in that intersection between humanity and technology. But in the end the best way to summarize 
                everything I love about providing technical support is the variety. I get to work with many different types of companies, 
                people, and technologies. I get to apply my skills in many ways, and the growth potential is almost limitless.

                Before finding the job listing I never knew it existed. I have only recently begun looking in to learning how to use 
                Docker, and github deployments. I didn’t know that a service like Netlify automated the process in addition to providing 
                a CDN. Getting this single page up and running didn’t take long at all, and it’s faster than the hosting I have setup 
                with digitalocean. One thing I’m curious about is what the bandwidth and storage limits are since it’s not immediately 
                obvious when looking at the pricing page.

                While I have experience using React to build full web apps, and I’m currently learning React Native, I have never used 
                Gatsby before this project. Luckily building React components is familiar to me, but much was changed since Gatsby uses 
                templates, does not give direct access to React Router, and uses a different directory structure with some new files. 
                It also has a different ways of setting up the default html file. I read through the Github repo, looked at some examples, 
                added materialize.css to help with styling, then I was up and running pretty quickly. I spent more time getting the Webpack
                File-loader working properly to get the _redirects file in the root directory during the build process than I did getting
                Gatsby up and running.

                Particularly so because I’m still a bit in the dark about what the actual moment to moment work will be like. 
                Based on that, the best advice I can give is to provide more information on what a day is like for a Support Engineer 
                at Netlify. That would add context to the information already given so that candidates will have a better feel for the job, 
                and also be better able to answer the questions asked.

            <div className="card-panel blue darken-1">
              <p className="white-text"><strong>SSL/HTTPS is important because security and privacy are important. </strong> 
                People share a lot personal information online. From private details about their lives to payment information. 
                I believe that they have a right to have their data secure. They also have a right to a certain level of privacy and 
                security from malicious groups and in some cases, governments. It is good practice for sites and services to encrypt 
                connections via SSL and use HTTPS to ensure there that data can be transferred securely across the internet.</p>
                <p className="white-text">
                I personally pushed for the company I currently work for to implement SSL everywhere, instead of only when logging in. 
                This is because it also gives people peace of mind. It is more than just keeping your private information secure from 
                hackers. This is particularly of importance in recent years with ISP’s selling web surfing data and logging user actions 
                not just when surfing, but also the various IoT devices they are using on their neworks. More SSL and a greater emphasis 
                on security and privacy is a good thing, and a net win for society as a whole, and the protection of individual liberties.

            <div className="card-panel blue darken-1">
              <p className="white-text"><strong>Two major challenges for non-tech savvy users configuring DNS are it's complexity,
                and the the different setup options. </strong> The broad definition for DNS is simple to understand, but there are multiple 
                ways and combinations to setup DNS for domain names, and services. “A” records for IP resolution, "CNAME" to point to another 
                domain, "MX" for e-mail, "SRV" records, etc.  If you use your domain for Google Apps, or Microsoft’s 365 suite, you end up 
                configuring so many things that if you aren’t trained in this technology, you’ll quickly be lost. DNS can be used not just 
                for pointing a domain at an IP but to help with load balancing and other concepts that someone who is not tech-savvy will 
                have a hard time understanding. </p>
      
                <p className="white-text">
                An extension of this complexity is that there are also multiple ways of using DNS to achieve similar goals. For instance, 
                you may setup "CNAME" to point your domain to another server that has a domain setup, or “A” records to point straight at 
                your servers IP, the IP of your load balancer, etc., 301 redirect to send visitors to another URL, and so forth. These all 
                use DNS to send people going to your domain to a particular server, but they each have slightly different use-cases. 
                Because of the variety and complexity of DNS, in addition to the adjacent concepts and technologies related to using DNS, 
                it can be hard for non-tech savvy users to get a handle on it.
